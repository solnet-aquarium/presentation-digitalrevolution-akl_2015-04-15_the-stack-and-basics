# Package management

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Like bower, provides a massive array of modules ready to use. 

Should come with nodejs - if you've got `node`, you should also have `npm`.

Very simple to setup, use a package.json file like:

```JSON
{
  "dependencies": {
    "jasmine": "^2.1.0",
    "karma": "^0.12.28"
  }
}
```

Then run `npm install`.
