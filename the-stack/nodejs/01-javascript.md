# Node.js

You're writing a server app, unit tests for front end or backend JS, or some tooling

You will use JavaScript.

Again, you can use ECMA6 if you want - if you're going to be deploying, you have to make sure the correct version is available.

## NVM

Strongly recommend using [creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) on your local machine. This will let you switch between node versions.
