Will save your life.

 - Code that implements native features of later versions of JS in pure JS, allowing you to code as if they exist even in older browsers

 ## Difference between a PolyFill and a Shim
 
> Citing [Axel Rauschmayer](http://rauschma.de/) from his book [Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/):
> > A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.
> > A polyfill is a shim for a browser API. It typically checks if a browser supports an API. If it doesnâ€™t, the polyfill installs its own implementation. That allows you to use the API in either case.
