# JavaScript

JavaScript is the substrate upon which most of what we talk about here is built.

In general terms: JavaScript = JS = ES = ECMA = ECMAScript

> ECMAScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease.

 - The current minimum you should code for is ECMA5.
  - Technically this excludes IE8, but polyfills
  - This includes NodeJS

## Change is coming

ECMAScript 6 is basically out. You can use it in Chrome if you start it by going to `chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony` and enabling the flag, restarting chrome.

You can use it in anger by compiling it down to ES5 with [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/). 

With. All. Features.
